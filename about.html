            <h1>William Derichsweiler</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is William Derichsweiler, I'm a 26-year-old tech enthusiast, problem solver, competitor, and explorer. These are the things that drive me every day. These passions are not just something that showed up overnight. I would say that all of these have been rooted in me since I was a child. It all started with a game. I was 8 years old and my parents got me and my siblings Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo. I know it sounds like the nerdiest thing ever, but I was immediately enthralled by the game. It was the first time in my life that I had ever used technology to solve a problem, compete against the people around me, and explore a situation that I wasn't currently in. I was amazed by this. From there, my love for games only grew. It doesn't matter what kind of game it is but if it allows me to tap into the four passions above, I can almost guarantee that I will like it.</p>
            <p>Let's start with technology. As I mentioned before, video games were my first experience with technology. From a young age I was always intrigued and interested, not only with the game itself, but how it was made, the ideas that went into creating these different worlds, and process it takes to turn letters, numbers, and symbols into what seems like a completely new reality. As I got older, I began to think more and more about all the systems and technology that people use not only in everyday life but as the infrastructure in their business. How are these systems being created that everyone is tapping into daily? These could be the apps on our phones, the websites that make it easier for us to pay our bills, or the software used to track customer success and relations. I wanted to learn and still want to learn everything there is to know about how we can leverage technology to turn our pains into strengths.</p>
            <p>Then we have problem-solving. One of the core elements of games is presenting a problem that needs to be solved to either progress or complete the game. With Super Mario as the example, the problem was to figure out the best way to navigate each level, make it to Bowser Castle, then beat Bowser and save Princess Peach. Each level was different and required a different approach. Beating a level and making it to the end was one of the greatest feelings as a kid. I couldn’t help but feel like I had conquered the world every time I heard that victory music at the end and every level completed was just one step closer to beating the game. This desire to find answers and discover strategies has become a part of me as I’ve grown up. It didn’t matter if it was correctly answering questions in school or finding the best strategy for my clients, I love getting to make progress toward the goal.</p>
            <p>Next is competing. While games started my interest in technology and sparked my love for problem-solving, they also gave me my first taste of what it was like to compete. It didn’t matter what kind of game or sport it was I loved the feeling of trying to outdo myself or test my skills against another person. It was always better if I managed to win but I’ve never been afraid of losing either. Sure, losing doesn’t feel great but it taught me that I always have something that I can get better at. Losing teaches me that sometimes I may just need to get better at the skills I already have or that I may need to come up with a completely new approach. I will always love to compete and will never stop striving to try and be better than I was the day before.</p>
            <p>Finally, we come to exploration. Experiencing games not only taught me the attributes above but they also introduced me to completely new worlds to discover. Each world was different and had something different to offer. This created a desire to explore my own world too. I lived in Oklahoma most of my life but was lucky enough to travel all over the US while growing up there. I have visited nearly 30 states, lived on the east coast in Greensboro, NC, and last year I took a road trip with my fiancée from North Carolina to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico where we lived for six months. After that we embarked on another road trip up the west coast of North America all the way to Vancouver, Canada, down to Utah to see Zion National Park and Antelope Canyon, finally landing us back in Norman, OK for a few months. I have been extremely blessed with the places I have been and the people in my life all thanks to this desire to explore.</p>
            <p>The lessons games taught me went well beyond the games themselves. These lessons became passions and what makes up the very core of who I am. I love to learn about technology, solve problems, compete at everything, and explore the world around me. My name is William Derichsweiler, it’s nice to meet you, let’s get to work.</p>
